Problem Statement

We are a city planner responsible for improving travel efficiency between multiple cities in a region. The cities are connected by a network of roads, and each road has a specific capacity (maximum number of cars that can travel at once) and cost (construction or maintenance cost). Our goal is to: Select the most important roads for optimization based on their capacity and cost and calculate the shortest travel times between all pairs of cities to help commuters and logistics companies plan their routes.
